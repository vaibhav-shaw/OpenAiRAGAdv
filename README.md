# RAG with Multi Data Source

This project demonstrates the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from multiple data sources. Specifically, it leverages the Langchain community's tools to query Wikipedia and retrieve relevant information based on user inputs.

## Features

- **Wikipedia API**: Uses Wikipedia's API for querying and retrieving data.
- **Langchain Integration**: Combines Langchain's tools for flexible query execution.
- **RAG Implementation**: Example of how to use Retrieval-Augmented Generation to enhance responses using external knowledge.
